# Book Finder App

**Book Finder** is a web-based application that uses the *Wimpole model*, an AI object recognition system, to identify books from their spines without removing them from the shelves. It retrieves detailed metadata about each book and makes previously inaccessible historic collections available to the public through augmented reality.

## Project Background

This tool was developed as part of the **Augmented Browsing of Books in Historic Libraries** project led by the University of the Arts London (CCW Graduate School). The project aimed to address a common issue in historic houses and libraries, where books, despite being significant collections, are not accessible to visitors. A notable case is **Wimpole Hall**, which holds a fully catalogued but physically inaccessible book collection.

The solution involves mobile-based AR technology allowing users to hover their phone cameras in front of book spines to identify volumes and access detailed information without handling the physical objects.
