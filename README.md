## Abstract

This project addresses a significant problem in historic houses: the fact that books, which are among their most important collections, are not accessible to visitors. This is a widespread issue in historic university and cathedral libraries, as well as in many National Trust properties. A notable example is **Wimpole Hall**, where the fully catalogued book collection remains inaccessible to visitors.

The aim of the project is to make such library collections available to the public through **Augmented Reality (AR)** technology, enabling on-site browsing of books via a mobile device without removing them from the shelves. This approach eliminates the risk of damage and enriches the visitor experience by extending access to the library collections.

The project brings together experts in augmented reality and book history to produce a pilot system for a small number of books at Wimpole Hall. The system identifies individual volumes by hovering a mobile phone camera in front of a shelf and overlays relevant metadata and content in front of the live camera feed. This system will be tested on-site at Wimpole Hall with members of the public.
